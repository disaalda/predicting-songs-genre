# Predicting a Song's Genre

Project from Winter 2019 to classify song lyrics' genres. 

- **predict_songs_genre.py**: cleans the lyrics dataset, trains Naive Bayes Classifier models (Multinomial, Gaussian, Bernoulli), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine models, and predicts the test set.
- **wordcloud_dataviz.ipynb**: creates wordcloud from the cleaned lyrics dataset.

Due to large data size, I did not attach the data files.
